## Terraform Interview Question & Answeres
==============================================

Q.) Terraform :- It's a infrastructure tool where you can create a template & based on that, infrastrucure gets created.
                 It is compatible with AWS, Azure, GCP & VMware.
 
 
Q.) Can Ansible create infrastucure?
A.) Ansible is a configuration management tool but it can also create whole infrasturcure with complex playbook which is difficult to manage.

Q.) Cloudformation VS Terraform ?
A.) Cloudformation is also an Infrastecure as code(IAAS) but drawback is , it's compatible only in AWS. This can not deal with anyother cloud plteform. Where Terraform has an ability to work in any cloudplatform.
    Also, you can not create a keypair & have to mention hard-coded in cloudformation where Terraform can create that.

Q.) what is Terraform Resource ?
A.) Resource is like a service which you can use for provisioning.
    Ex:- aws_instance, s3, rds, vpc

Q.) Can i run specific module on specific resource or ec2/host/server, instead off running all module in all server?
A.) yes, you can run perticular module on specific resource or host/server/ec2.    ---> https://jhooq.com/terraform-run-specific-resource/

Senerio-a.)
1.) Single module on sigle host using -target=resource :-                  
terraform apply -target=module.module-1.aws_instance.my_ec2_instance                   ## module :- it's a prifix/parameter, if you're using any module
                                                                                       ## module-1 :- it is name of the module which you're using.
2.) Running speciific resource or ec2/server/ host without module:-                    ## aws_instance :- This is the instance type(resource) that I am targetting to run or apply
terraform apply -target=aws_instance.my_ec2_instance                                   ## my_ec2_instance:- It is the name of my host/server/instance on which I am targetting to run or apply

Senerio-b.)
1.) specifing Multiple modules on specific Multiple resources or ec2/server/host
terraform apply -target=module.module-1.aws_instance.my_ec2_instance_1 -target=module.module-2.aws_instance.my_ec2_instance_2 

Q.) What is Terraform Output values & why do we use it ? 
A.) Terraform output values will be really useful when you want to debug your terraform code. 
    Terraform output values can help you to print the attributes reference(arn, instance_state, outpost_arn, public_ip, public_dns etc) on your console.
    syntex:- output "my_console_output" {
               value = aws_instance.my_ec2_instance.public_ip       ##{aws_instance=resource, my_ec2_instance=server name, public_ip=attribute}
             }
##Note:- you can mention output paramter in "main.tf" or create a seperate file "output.tf" (recommanded).
